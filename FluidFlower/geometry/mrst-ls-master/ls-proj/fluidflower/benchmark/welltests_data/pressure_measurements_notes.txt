Notes pressure measurements

Alle pressures in [bar] and temperature in [Celcius]

Note that some ports have multiple pressure transducers
The range of each pressure transducer is listed in the heading (e.g. 0-2.5 bar)

Accuracy (NLHR) Â±0.15% of span BFSL (NLHR = non-linearity, hysteresis and repeatability; BFSL = Best Fit Straight Line)
